# Exercise 2.1: String concatenation (15 minutes)

Write a function which receives a name, e.g. "James Bond" and prints: "My name is Bond, James Bond".

- Start first with printing "My name is James Bond".
- Work on solutions incrementally.
- It is totally OK to solve it only halfway, but if you have time left,
  go for the "My name is Bond, James Bond".
