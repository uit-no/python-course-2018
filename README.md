# Preliminary schedule

## Session 1 (Lars, Radovan)

- Functions, data structures, and syntax
- how to print things, f-strings
- PEP8, pycodestyle, pylint


### Examples/challenges:

- Playing with lists / dictionaries in the REPL
- Slicing lists
- range
- looping over elements, enumerate(), reversed(), sorted() and .sort()
- how to copy list and possible pitfalls
- as soon as we go for functions we work in the editor
- for functions we start with some repetitive code and abstract it into a function


## Session 2 (Radovan, Lars)

- string handling and parsing
- f-strings vs .format
- parsing problem
- basic file I/O
- passing arguments from command line
- error handling: IOError, traceback, try/except
- example first write “to screen”, then writing something into a file
- string handling, also consider “+” vs. append/split/join
- preparing input files from a template
- extracting data
- simple example of running non-python out of python


## Session 3 (Radovan)

- memory example for reading a large file
- parsing large files, iterators
- csv: reading writing with the csv module
- prepare an example which prints consumed memory
- then we show naive way and better way
- reading and parsing a large-ish file


### Structuring projects: half a session

- understanding imports
- underscore convention
- collecting functions into modules
- example will be one big script: divide into modules and import stuff
- only mention packages
- pip/conda install, requirements.txt


## Session 4 (Dan)

- plotting
- Jupyter notebooks
- hello world demo of pandas


## Session 5

- “talk to the doctor”, bring your own real-life “problems”
- these are discussed together
- instructors try to live-code solutions for real-life challenges with feedback
  from everybody
