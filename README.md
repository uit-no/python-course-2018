## Session 1: Introduction to programming and Python (Lars)

- [First steps](session-1/first contact.ipynb)
  - expressions, statements, variables, calling functions
  - basic data types and objects
  - how to print things, f-strings
  - basic control flow (if-then-else, while)
  - writing functions
- Python's useful data structures: list, tuple, dict, [set]
- [PEP8, pycodestyle, pylint]


### Examples/challenges:

- Playing with lists / dictionaries in the REPL
- Slicing lists
- range
- looping over elements, enumerate(), reversed(), sorted() and .sort()
- how to copy list and possible pitfalls
- as soon as we go for functions we work in the editor
- for functions we start with some repetitive code and abstract it into a function


## Session 2: String handling and input/output (Radovan)

  - string handling: f-strings vs .format, “+” vs. append/split/join
  - basic file input/output
  - parsing and data extraction
  - passing command line arguments to a script
  - error handling: IOError, traceback, try/except
- [2.1](session-2/part-1.md)

  - templating
  - simple example of running non-python out of python
  - memory example for reading a large file
  - parsing large files, iterators
  - csv: reading writing with the csv module
  - prepare an example which prints consumed memory
  - then we show naive way and better way
  - reading and parsing a large-ish file
- [3.1](session-3/part-1.md)
- [3.2](session-3/part-2.md)

## Session 4: Jupyter, plotting, and Pandas (Dan)

- plotting
- Jupyter notebooks
- hello world demo of pandas


## Session 5: "talk to the doctor" (all instructors)

- bring your own real-life "problems"
- these are discussed together
- instructors try to live-code solutions for real-life challenges
  with feedback from everybody
