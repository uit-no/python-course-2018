# Preliminary schedule

## Session 1 (Lars, Radovan)

- Functions, data structures, and syntax
- how to print things, f-strings
- PEP8, pycodestyle, pylint


### Examples/challenges:

- Playing with lists / dictionaries in the REPL
- Slicing lists
- range
- looping over elements, enumerate(), reversed(), sorted() and .sort()
- how to copy list and possible pitfalls
- as soon as we go for functions we work in the editor
- for functions we start with some repetitive code and abstract it into a function


## Session 2 (Radovan, Lars)

- Topics
  - string handling: f-strings vs .format, “+” vs. append/split/join
  - basic file input/output
  - parsing and data extraction
  - passing command line arguments to a script
  - error handling: IOError, traceback, try/except
  - simple example of running non-python out of python
- [Exercises](session-2/exercises.md)


## Session 3 (Radovan)

- Topics
  - memory example for reading a large file
  - parsing large files, iterators
  - csv: reading writing with the csv module
  - prepare an example which prints consumed memory
  - then we show naive way and better way
  - reading and parsing a large-ish file
- [Exercises](session-3/exercises.md)


### Structuring projects: half a session

- understanding imports
- underscore convention
- collecting functions into modules
- example will be one big script: divide into modules and import stuff
- only mention packages
- pip/conda install, requirements.txt


## Session 4 (Dan)

- plotting
- Jupyter notebooks
- hello world demo of pandas


## Session 5 (all instructors)

- “talk to the doctor”, bring your own real-life “problems”
- these are discussed together
- instructors try to live-code solutions for real-life challenges with feedback
  from everybody
