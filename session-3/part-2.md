# Exercise 3.1: Rolling Stone magazine's 2012 list of 500 greatest albums of all time

(provide a wget-able address)

- Create a file `top500.csv` and copy-paste https://www.datazar.com/file/fab8ac573-12b3-4b30-9f1d-2bd5ff62b1e8 into it.
- Create a script that:
  - Counts the number of "Radiohead" albums.
  - Prints out all titles of "Radiohead" albums in this list.
  - Prints out all titles of an artist/band that can be provided
    as command line argument (be careful with spaces in band names).
  - Adjust your script so that it is case insensitive to input.
- Take-home optional steps:
  - Prints the 5 artists/band with most albums in this list.
  - Plot a graph with number of albums as a function of years
    (but also OK to postpone this to plotting session).
  - Port your script to use the csv module.
